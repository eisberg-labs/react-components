# Contributing to react-components

Thanks for your interest and work in react components.

## Getting Started

React Components [open issues are here](https://github.com/eisberg-labs/react-components/issues). Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated. 

For some tips on contributing to open source, this [post is helpful](https://smartbear.com/blog/14-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-being/).

## Contributions

Everyone is welcome to contribute.

Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will
be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the
main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the main branch and, if needed, rebase to the current main
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  main you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests). 
  
- Commit messages should be capitalized and short. For other 
  recommendations on  writing commit messages take a look 
  at [this helpful post](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

- Don't put submodule updates in your pull request unless they are to landed
  commits.

- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review
  it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a
  comment.

- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
